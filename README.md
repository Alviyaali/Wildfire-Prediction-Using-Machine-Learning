# Wildfire-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
 Objective 
• To analyze key meteorological and spatial factors influencing wildfire 
spread. 
• To develop and compare multiple machine learning models for predicting 
the burned area of wildfires. 
• To evaluate the performance of these models using standard regression 
metrics. 
• To provide insights that enhance wildfire risk assessment and emergency 
preparedness.
